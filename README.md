## Overview
The Housing Market Prediction project leverages machine learning to estimate the current and future value of homes based on address data, with a focus on the Bloomington, Indiana housing market. This project uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and prediction models to achieve accurate results.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for clean input
- Feature engineering specific to real estate data
- Model training and evaluation for price prediction
- Results visualization


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd FA24-CSCI-B351-Housing-Market-Prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook if using notebooks (You can also just use VS Code if you already have and use or prefer it.):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is activated.
2. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
3. (Optional) Launch Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis (You can also just use VS Code if you already have and use or prefer it.):
   ```bash
   cd projectDirectory
   jupyter lab # or code . # if you have the terminal extension installed you can run it.
   ```
4. Run the python notebook in either VS Code or Jupyter Labs. The results will appear at the bottom of the notebook if ran and setup correctly.
